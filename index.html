<h1 style="border: 2px solid Violet;">My first game; The Falling Spike Game</h1>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">My first game I started and completed is the falling spike game.  I customized it with colours and details to make it unique as my own. You play as a little cat and you move around across the screen trying to dodge the randomly spawned falling spikes. Everytime you respawn, the background changes at random to one of the 5 chosen colours. At the bottom of the screen your score is shown to you, going up each second you stay alive.</p>
